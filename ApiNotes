Refer Screenshot for architecture(RS)
1.The above architecture is a service oriented architecture 
2.Testing the app in the source code layer/Bussiness layer is called as API Testing
3.there are 3 types of api testing
  3.1) a)White Box Testing : WBT is done by the developer
       b)testing the untouched source code of the app via another java program is called as WBT
  3.2)SOAP
  3.3)REST

Soap in this wsdl is used to communication
WSDL protocol: web services description language : used for info exchange(like http methods for xml-wsdl)like http protocol

http://localhost:8091  --->url
/add/2/3  ---->endpoints(method name and parametetrs/query)


REST: representational state transfer technology
Why REST?
1.language independent
2.no need extra protocol(usses http protocol)
3.it can use both xml and json
4.using json is easy



Web Services API Testing:
  As name indicates services available over the web is called as web services.
  
1.The client request from the application via communication protocol such as HTTP, and generate response back to the client.
2.WebServices is a concept and platform independent.
3.WebServices help web application to interact with any other applications like Mobile,WebApp running on same or different platform
4.WebServices has 2 participants 
   4.1)Service Provider: it is the one who develops/exposes web services over the web
       b)whenever a service is exposed over a URL it is known as REST Web Services 
       c)whenever a service is exposed via WSDL file it is known as Soap Web Services 
   4.2)Service Consumer: it is the one who consumes or uses the web services 
   
Advantages of WebServices

1.WebServices are inter operable i.e they are platform application and technology independent   
2.It is loosly Coupled i.e each app is independent of one another hence changes made on one side does not impact on other side
3.service Reusability i.e web services will open the door for new business opportunity by making easy to connect with the partners 
4.No need of re inventing the wheel i.e web services reduces the software development time which will help the person to quickly develop
  an application and start the business.
  
  
REST: stands for REpresentational State Transfer 
1.it is an architectural style to communicate and transfer the data between 2 applications

Why Rest is popular?/advantages of rest web services?

1.Rest is an architectural style and doesnot require any additional protocol
2.Quick response
3.It can return both XML and JSON
4.it is language independent
5.Easy integration with GUI/Mobile
6.Parsing Data will be easier
