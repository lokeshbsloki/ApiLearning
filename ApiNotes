Refer Screenshot for architecture(RS)
1.The above architecture is a service oriented architecture 
2.Testing the app in the source code layer/Bussiness layer is called as API Testing
3.there are 3 types of api testing
  3.1) a)White Box Testing : WBT is done by the developer
       b)testing the untouched source code of the app via another java program is called as WBT
  3.2)SOAP
  3.3)REST

Soap in this wsdl is used to communication
WSDL protocol: web services description language : used for info exchange(like http methods for xml-wsdl)like http protocol

http://localhost:8091  --->url
/add/2/3  ---->endpoints(method name and parametetrs/query)


REST: representational state transfer technology
Why REST?
1.language independent
2.no need extra protocol(usses http protocol)
3.it can use both xml and json
4.using json is easy



Web Services API Testing:
  As name indicates services available over the web is called as web services.
  
1.The client request from the application via communication protocol such as HTTP, and generate response back to the client.
2.WebServices is a concept and platform independent.
3.WebServices help web application to interact with any other applications like Mobile,WebApp running on same or different platform
4.WebServices has 2 participants 
   4.1)Service Provider: it is the one who develops/exposes web services over the web
       b)whenever a service is exposed over a URL it is known as REST Web Services 
       c)whenever a service is exposed via WSDL file it is known as Soap Web Services 
   4.2)Service Consumer: it is the one who consumes or uses the web services 
   
Advantages of WebServices

1.WebServices are inter operable i.e they are platform application and technology independent   
2.It is loosly Coupled i.e each app is independent of one another hence changes made on one side does not impact on other side
3.service Reusability i.e web services will open the door for new business opportunity by making easy to connect with the partners 
4.No need of re inventing the wheel i.e web services reduces the software development time which will help the person to quickly develop
  an application and start the business.
  
  
REST: stands for REpresentational State Transfer 
1.it is an architectural style to communicate and transfer the data between 2 applications

Why Rest is popular?/advantages of rest web services?

1.Rest is an architectural style and doesnot require any additional protocol
2.Quick response
3.It can return both XML and JSON
4.it is language independent
5.Easy integration with GUI/Mobile
6.Parsing Data will be easier


Popular Tools Available For REST API Testing
1.PostMan
2.RestClient
3.RestAssured

Assignment
find app which integated 2 apps(5 apps)
1.PUBG             -->uses FaceBook api
2.INDIGO 		   -->uses AIR asia,and many other flights company api
3.MYJIO 	       -->uses paytm api to recharge 
4.Payment Gateway  --> uses bank api to pay
5.foodpanda        -->uses hotels api
6.oyo              -->uses hotels api




Postman
how to create a collection?
1.click on the new button on left-top corner/ file-new
2.select collection,enter the collection name and click on create.

URI-stands for Uniform Resource Identifier
1.it is a sequence of characters that allows the complete identification of any physical resource 

URL-Uniform Resource Locator
1.it is a subset of URI that defines where the resource is available i.e. it provides the means of locating the resource by describing
  its primary access mechanism
  
EndPoint:(URI=URL+endpoint)
An endpoint defines the location of the resource /
The place where a client can send a request where resource is present is called as an EndPoint.

Path Parameter:http: here    URI      		=//localhost:3000/posts/{id}
                             URL	  		=//localhost:3000
                             endpoint 		=/posts
                             path parameter =/{id}
                             URI            =URL+EndPoint+PathParameter
                             To get localhost: cmd+ipconfig+enter :ipv4 address
                             
1.it is a type of parameter that lives within end point of URI
2.path parameters help us to access a single resource 
3.path parameters are surrounded by curly brackets 
 eg:Ex: /posts/{id}
 
 assignment:repeate http methods of posts to comments and profile
            like http://localhost:3000/comments
                 http://localhost:3000/profile
                 
Query Parameter:
1.it is separated by a question mark(?) in the url.
2.it appears and the end of the url after the ? mark    
3.the ? ,the parameter and its real value is refered to as query String  
4. the features of query parameters are 
    4.1)they are optional
    4.2)they are non unique
    
diff btw path and query parameter?
1.part of uri/1.separated by ?
2.just value/2.key and value pair


Environmental Variables: it allows the use of the variables for different environments such as development,testing,production
2.only one environment can be active at a time

steps to create environment: 
1.click on the manage environment icon 
2.select create new environment 
3.click on add , enter the envi name ,specify the variables and click on add
4.to select an environment from the drop down
5.to get variable we should use {{}}


Collection Variables:1.These are available thorought the request in a collection and are independent of environment
                     i.e they need not change based on the selected environment               
2.These are suitable if we are using single environment for eg to define URL authorization

steps to create 
1.go to perticluar collection
2.click on edit , click on variables,enter the variables and click on update
3. to use it we use {{url}} -->url=http://localhost:3000
