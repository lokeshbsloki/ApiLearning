1)HTTP    :Hypertext transfer protocol :communication between client and server is done by sending HTTP 
           resuest and receving http response

Http Request/response
1.A client(browser) sends an http request to the webserver.
2.Webserver receives the request. 
3.Server will run an application to process the request.
4.server returns a http response to the browser.
5.the client receives the response.

Http Structure: Like in HTML, HTTP protocol also has header and body.
Header and body are seperated by space.

HTTP Response Key elements:
1.Status code    :It represents the status of the HTTP request.it is the mandatory info and it is present in the header of the response.
2.Content-Type   :It is not mandatory info available in the header of the http response which specify type of Content available in the
                  response body.
                  eg: html  text/html
                      xml   Application/xml
                      JSON  Application/json
                      zip   Application/zip
                      Image File/Png
3.Actual-Data   :it is not mandatory(optional) implimentation present in the body of http response.it is the actual info/data which 
                 we are going to receive from server.
                 

HTTP Request Key elements:  
1.Http Method   :it is mandatory element present in the header of the http request.it specifies the the type of request sent by the 
                  client they are 8 http methods available they are GET,POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE,OPTIONS,HEADER,TRACE 
2.WebUrl        :it is an mandatory element present in the http request.it is used to identify the specific resource in the web
                 application(Static-data will be constant/Dynamic-data will be change acc to request or user)
3.Cookies       : Data stored in the browser.                                            

(IQ:what kind of responses you have come across?)
Responses are grouped into 5 classes:
1.Information Responses(100-199)
2.Successful Responses(200-299)
3.Redirects(300-399)
4.Client Errors(400-499)
5.Server side errors(500-599)


XML   :it stands for Extended Markup Language.it is programming language and it is platform independent which helps to store and 
       communicate data between two applications which are built on same or different platforms(like java ,python,c#)
       
Structure of XML:
As name implies it is an extention of HTML.xml looks like html but all tags are user defined in xml and are case Insensitive
in XML we have to follow the syntax strictly

1.xml always starts with a prologue
   <?XML version="1.0" encoding="UFT-8">
   
2.we comment using <-- -->
3.XML structure follows tree structure like html.   
      <root>
            <child>
  					<subchild>
            	    </subchild>
           </child>
      </root> 
      
      eg:
      
          <bookstore>
                    <catagories>
                         <catogory name="stories">
                              <book>
                                    <title>jumanji</title>
                                    <author>chris</author>
                              </book>
                         </catogory>
                         <catogory name="">
                             <book>
                                   <title></title>
                             </book>
                         </catogory>
                   </catogories>
         </bookstore>                                      
                             
 1. bookstore    -->element  
 2. name         -->attributes
 3. jumanji      -->PCData(parsed char data)(btw close>< and open tags)
 4. Cdata        -->char data-used to convert all info into char
                  syntax: <![CDATA[   ]]
 5. elements can be extended and attributes cannot  
 6.Entity reference:
          &gt    -->greater than
          &lt    -->lesserthan
          &amp   -->&
          &apos  -->'
          &gte   -->greater than equal to
          
          
Rules for defining xml elements
1.they are case sensitive
2.they must start with letter or underscore
3.cannot have spaces
4.it cannot use the reservered words

XML schema:
xml helps us to store and transfer the data from one app to another,while sending the data it is essential that both the apps have 
same expectations and agreements about the content of the xml.
we can define the schema in two ways 
1.XSD -->xml schema definition
2.DTD -->document type definition          
                                
                         
 XML parser   : parser is used to convert java to xml and viceversa
                JaxB is a inbuilt java parser available from java 1.6 onwards which is used to convert java to xml and viceversa
Converting java to xml is  -->marshalling
 Converting xml to java is -->unmarshalling
 
 
 POJO -->page old java object
 
 JSON  -->stands for Java Script Object Notation
          (programing language and platform independent ,light weight ,java script is easily convertible)
          like XML ,JSON is also programming language and platform independent which helps to store data and transfer data between 2 apps.
          running on same or different platform.
          JSON is light weight compare to XML.And it is very easy to parse data from client side.
          To convert java to JSON we can use GSON or JACKSON API.
          
          
JSON Format:
1.json content always in the form of KEY:VALUE pair. 
2.{} is represents an object.
3.[] represents an array
4.Key and Value are seperated by a colon(:)
5.Data are sepearted by comma(,)
6.Keys are always a string("")
7.Data or value can be a string/an array/an object

Example:JSON Object

{
  "Books":[
               {
                  "id"     :123,
                  "name"   :"2states",
                  "author" :"chethan Bhagath"
               },
               {
                  "id"     :124,
                  "name"   :"3idiots",
                  "author" :"chethan Bhagath"
               }
          ]
}
  
JSON Value Data type:
{
        "name"     : "lokesh",                 ------>String
        "id"       : 123,                      ------>Number
        "contract" : true,                     ------>Boolean
        "wife"     : null,     			      ------>Object
        "mobile"   : [8618958034,8553953873],  ------>Array
        "car"      : [                         ------>Array of Objects
                        {
                          "name":"Etios"
                          "Type":"Petrol"
                        },  
                         {
                          "name":"Audi"
                          "Type":"Petrol"
                        }
                    ]    
}  


Difference between JSON and Xml
   JSON || XML
1.it is a way of representing the object in the form of Key:value pairs ||  1.it is a markup language uses tag structure to 
                                                                               represent the data
2.Json is light weight compare to xml
3.Json structure is simple compare to XML
4.Json supports an Array but xml doesnot support an array.
5.In a webservices is develop in json it is called as RESTFULL Web Services || web services developed by xml called 
																			   Soap Web Services   
6.No prologue in Json || it is present in xml
